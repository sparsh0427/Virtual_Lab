                        Cryptography is the study and practice of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third 
                        parties called adversaries. It deals with developing and analyzing protocols which prevents malicious third
                      parties from retrieving information being shared between two entities thereby following the various aspects of information security.

                                <p>Anyone who needs to send a message to Bob can use n and e. For example, if Alice needs to send a message to Bob, she can change the message, usually a short one, to an integer. This is the plaintext. She then calculates the ciphertext, using e and n. C = P^e ( mod n ) Alice sends C, the ciphertext, to Bob.

                                    A repeater is an electronic device that amplifies the signal it receives. You can think of a repeater as a device which receives a signal and retransmits it at a higher level or higher power so that the signal can cover longer distances, more than 100 meters for standard LAN cables. Repeaters work on the Physical layer.
                                    There are several different types of repeaters; a telephone repeater is an amplifier in a telephone line, an optical repeater is an optoelectronic circuit that amplifies the light beam in an optical fiber cable; and a radio repeater is a radio receiver and transmitter that retransmits a radio signal.
                                    <br>broadcast relay station is a repeater used in broadcast radio and television.

                                    NIC allows a networking device to communicate with the other networking device.
                                    NIC converts the data packets between two different data transmission technologies. A PC uses parallel data transmission technology to transmit the data between its internal parts while the media that provides connectivity between different PCs uses serial data transmission technology.
                                    <br>There are 2 types of NIC:-<br>

                                    MAU and Patch Panel look like the Hub, but they are different. MAU (Multi Access Unit) is the sibling of Hub for the token ring network. Differences between Hub and MAU are the following: -
                                    <br>Hub is used for the Ethernet Network while the MAU is used for the Token ring network.
                                    <br>Hub creates logically star topology while MAU creates logically ring topology.

                                    Proxy is used to hide the internal network from the external world. It can be a dedicated device or can be an application software. Once it is configured, all communication goes through it. Since external devices cannot access the internal devices directly, they cannot tamper with the internal devices.

                                <p>
                                    Transceiver is a small device that has the capability of receiving and sending both types of signals; analog and digital. Usually, it is inbuilt in network interface card. But, it is also available as an individual device. It detects the type of signal from the network wire and converts the passing signal accordingly.
                                    For example, a transceiver is attached with a device that transmits signal in digital form. Now suppose, this device is connected with the network wire that uses analog form for data transmission. In this case, the transceiver converts digital signals in the analog signals before placing them in the network wire.

                                    In computing, a firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external network, such as the Internet.
                                    Firewalls are often categorized as either network firewalls or host-based firewalls. Network firewalls filter traffic between two or more networks and run on network hardware. Host-based firewalls run on host computers and control network traffic in and out of those machines.
